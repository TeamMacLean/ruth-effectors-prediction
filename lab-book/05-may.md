Daily lab book May
==================

01 May 2019 (Wednesday)
----------------------

- figured out how to get the information / data from the `.log` file of CNN model using sep convolutional 1D


02 - 03 May 2019 (Thursday and Friday)
----------------------

- continue the extract the information from the `.log` file
- getting the non-effector data from the NCBI (per organism, put inside the collection)

06 May 2019 (Monday -- Bank holiday)
------------------------------------

07 May 2019 (Tuesday)
---------------------

- add the verbose to get more info in the log file of the scripts that will be run in the GPU cluster
- install BLAST and learn how it works

**Weekly catch up minutes**

- Make sure focus on what the objectives are (not to overdoing something)
- While waiting for the first model run to finish, I can create another model for sub-cellular localisation (LSTM + CNN model)
- Get the training, validation, and testing data. Compare the sequence in those set of data using BLAST, and report to Dan on Monday which data will get rid of. 

08, 09May 2019 (Wednesday and Thursday)
-----------------------

- play a lil bit with BLAST (try using some data in a tutorial)
- started to work with my data
