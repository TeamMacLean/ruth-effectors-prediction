Commits: 5

#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - the autoplot I have created for prediction is not useful, plot of
    distribution probability would be more useful
  - need to work fully on manuscripts: complete some missing parts on
    the reports, and redo all of the plots,to be generated from the
    chunks

#### Worked on

  - finished the S3 objects for visualise convnet, also the draft of the
    vignette for that

Commits: 5

#### Worked on

  - fixed the plot in package, figure out the heatmap problem
  - complete the MS (redo all of the plots)
  - tried to test Ram data on deepredeff
  - running again test on other tools (found I tested wrong dataset)
  - tried to get some datasets from other tools and evaluated them on
    deepredeff

#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - do not edit on something I am not asked for (MS)
  - run the positive datasets from other packages so that they can be
    included in MS
  - think about when I want to release and think about the roadmap of
    the package

## 08–12 June 2020

Commits: 37

  - running some positive datasets from EffectorP, DeepT3, EffectiveT3,
    and effectR to be included in MS
  - completed missing parts in MS
  - continued the vignette, readme, and testing on deepredeff

3 days of annual leave

## 18–19 June 2020

Commits: 29

#### Worked on

  - setting up the continous integration in Travis CI and Github Action
  - setting up test coverage
  - complete some additional test that have not been done before (97%
    completed now)
  - fix the python configuration since for some operating sysem,
    tensorflow can’t be found
  - followed steps on releasing package in R package book

Commits: 24

#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - version of the package is wrong
  - make better tutorial for end user (explain more about limitation,
    dataset, output)
  - ask some student or user to read teh tutorial and give feedback

## 22–26 June 2020

Commits: 50

#### Worked on

  - set the Python requirements (Tensorflow and Keras) for users so that
    it will be easy for them while installing Deepredeff
  - make vignettes that is more easier for user to understand
  - contacted some students (Angus, Ola, Davies, Alice) to review the
    tutorials
  - make a short list of questions in google form for feedback
  - fixing the Python, TF installation in Windows

#### Weekly catchup meeting

There are some corrections on the package:

  - don’t make it like I force the users to use Tensorflow, make the
    alternative in the tutorial if someone already have reticulate
  - try to tidy up a bit the last chunck in quick start (maybe using
    reprex)
  - change model to taxon, and model with the model I have, also show
    the class predictor
  - change any pathogenity type to taxon
  - sigmoid called is s-score
  - put summary with more explanation
  - plot: any color blind free color pallette, label with capital
  - no need to show the command (echo = False) on the more examples in
    “more on predicting with deepredeff”
  - better organization in the “more on predicting with deepredeff” sine
    it seems like I made it for each taxon, specific format need to be
    used

#### Worked on

  - the structure of the function `predict_effector()`
  - summary(), not just using return cat(), but using print.summary() so
    that user can actually access the value of the summary.
  - writting new test functions
