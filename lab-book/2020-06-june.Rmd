## `r "2020-06-01" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- the autoplot I have created for prediction is not useful, plot of distribution probability would be more useful
- need to work fully on manuscripts: complete some missing parts on the reports, and redo all of the plots,to be generated from the chunks

#### Worked on

- finished the S3 objects for visualise convnet, also the draft of the vignette for that

## `r "2020-06-02" -> curr_date; "2020-06-05" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

#### Worked on

- fixed the plot in package, figure out the heatmap problem
- complete the MS (redo all of the plots)
- tried to test Ram data on deepredeff
- running again test on other tools (found I tested wrong dataset)
- tried to get some datasets from other tools and evaluated them on deepredeff

## `r "2020-06-08" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- do not edit on something I am not asked for (MS)
- run the positive datasets from other packages so that they can be included in MS
- think about when I want to release and think about the roadmap of the package 



## `r "2020-06-08" -> curr_date; "2020-06-12" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

- running some positive datasets from EffectorP, DeepT3, EffectiveT3, and effectR to be included in MS
- completed missing parts in MS
- continued the vignette, readme, and testing on deepredeff

## `r "2020-06-15" -> curr_date; "2020-06-17" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

3 days of annual leave

## `r "2020-06-18" -> curr_date; "2020-06-19" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`


#### Worked on

- setting up the continous integration in Travis CI and Github Action
- setting up test coverage
- complete some additional test that have not been done before (97% completed now)
- fix the python configuration since for some operating sysem, tensorflow can't be found
- followed steps on releasing package in R package book

## `r "2020-06-22" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- version of the package is wrong 
- make better tutorial for end user (explain more about limitation, dataset, output)
- ask some student or user to read teh tutorial and give feedback

## `r "2020-06-22" -> curr_date; "2020-06-26" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

#### Worked on

- set the Python requirements (Tensorflow and Keras) for users so that it will be easy for them while installing Deepredeff
- make vignettes that is more easier for user to understand
- contacted some students (Angus, Ola, Davies, Alice) to review the tutorials
- make a short list of questions in google form for feedback
- fixing the Python, TF installation in Windows

***


## `r "2020-06-29" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

There are some corrections on the package:

  - don't make it like I force the users to use Tensorflow, make the alternative in the tutorial if someone already have reticulate
  - try to tidy up a bit the last chunck in quick start (maybe using reprex)
  - change model to taxon, and model with the model I have, also show the class predictor
  - change any pathogenity type to taxon
  - sigmoid called is s-score
  - put summary with more explanation
  - plot: any color blind free color pallette, label with capital 
  - no need to show the command (echo = False) on the more examples in "more on predicting with deepredeff"
  - better organization in the "more on predicting with deepredeff" sine it seems like I made it for each taxon, specific format need to be used
  

## `r "2020-06-30" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- the structure of the function `predict_effector()`
- summary(), not just using return cat(), but using print.summary() so that user can actually access the value of the summary. 
- writting new test functions
