#### Worked on

  - making costumized venn diagram for the results of effector
    prediction
    [`plot_venn_diagram.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/plot_venn_diagram.R)

  - organised repositories for the python scripts

  - updated some R-scripts for:
    
      - plot correlation matrix (normal and clustered):
        [`plot_corr_matrix.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/plot_corr_matrix.R)
      - plot confusion matrix:
        [`plot_confusion_matrices.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/plot_confusion_matrices.R)
      - get accuracy given prediction results for multiple models in one
        dataframe:
        [`get_accuracy.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/get_accuracy.R)
