## 01 May 2019 (Wednesday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Figured out how to get the information / data from the `.log` file
    of CNN model using sep convolutional 1D.

## 02, 03 May 2019 (Thursday, Friday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Continue the extract the information from the `.log` file.
  - Getting the non-effector data from the NCBI (per organism, put
    inside the collection).

## 06 May 2019 (Monday) – Bank Holiday

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

## 07 May 2019 (Tuesday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Add the verbose to get more info in the log file of the scripts that
    will be run in the GPU cluster.
  - Install BLAST and learn how it works.

#### Weekly catch up minutes

  - Make sure focus on what the objectives are (not to overdoing
    something).
  - While waiting for the first model run to finish, I can create
    another model for sub-cellular localisation (LSTM + CNN model).
  - Get the training, validation, and testing data. Compare the sequence
    in those set of data using BLAST, and report to Dan on Monday which
    data will get rid of.

## 08, 09 May 2019 (Wednesday, Thursday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Play a little bit with BLAST (try using some data in a tutorial).
  - Started to work with my data.

## 10 May 2019 (Friday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Understanding the results and made the report using R.

-----

## 13 May 2019 (Monday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Learned RNN from *Deep Learning with Python*.
  - Tried to retrieve data from NCBI.

#### Weekly catch up meeting’s minutes

  - Draft model will be expected next Monday.
  - Continue finding sequences using API / Batch Entrez. Can’t be done
    using SRA.

## 14 May 2019 (Tuesday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date, to_date)` -->

#### Worked on

##### Effector Classification Project

  - Specified the categories of data that have been removed from the
    datasets (whether it is bacteria, fungi, or oomycetes)
  - Get new data from NCBI from Bacteria

##### Subcellular Localisation Project

  - Learned about word Embedding, sequence preprocessing in R
  - SimpleRNN, and the concepts of LSTM

## 15, 16, 17 May 2019 (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Read and learn about LSTM, GRU architectures
  - Create the draft of architecture models.
  - Added the additional effector and noneffector data to dataframe
    without identical protein. sequence (retrieve the fasta data on
    NCBI).
  - Check the models that have been running in GPUs.

-----

## 20 May 2019 (Monday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Updated the report.
  - Checked how much progress that has been achieved of the model
    running in cluster.

#### Weekly catch up meeting’s minutes

  - Think about grow structure, think carefully how each layer actually
    impact on the data and results (end to end process) \>\> balancing
    the layers.
  - Try to work with epoch max 40 (in the range 20 – 40).
  - It is better to have simple model that run quickly and can be
    analysed and give results quickly.

#### Next steps

  - Create simpler model with considering the grow structure (for CNN
    and also CNN + LSTM).
  - Start to encode the data that has been ready.

## 21 May 2019 (Tuesday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - TSL annual talks.

## 22 May 2019 (Wednesday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - BLAST again the last datasets (after the additional effector and
    non-effector).
  - Create new model for the CNN sep models (since the last one was
    cancelled).

## 23 May 2019 (Thursday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Demo to the SAB.
  - Encoding the data.

## 24 May 2019 (Friday)

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Continued with encoding data.
  - Created some models arcihtecture for subcellular localisation.
