## `r "2019-09-01" -> curr_date; "2019-09-20" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Built a skeleton for Report.
- Started to make Rmd template and started to make the report.

##### Sub-cellular localisation

- Getting subcellular multicompartment data from stractch (including read some reference papers).
- Process:
  - From the TAIR data, get all of protein that has location and with the charateristics EDA.
  - Learn about the data and see if we can already group them together.
- Issues:
  - Same ID proteins has more than one location, we needed to analyze there.
  - There are more than 150 locations, therefore it is not possible to have 150 labels.
- Actions:
  - Made analysis using histogram and see how the locations of protein disributes.
  - Take only protein with one location.
  - Using reference to determine the location that is going to be used.
    The locations are: Chloroplast, Cytoplasm, Nucleus, Peroxisome, Plasma. Membrane, Vacuole, ER, Extracellular, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria (labeled as reference).
  - There are three different cases in how we grouped the protein. (See the reports).


##### Effector and Non-effector prediction

- Constructed four different models for effector and non-effector project:
  - CNN - LSTM.
  - CNN - GRU.
  - LSTM - Embedding.
  - GRU - Embedding.

When we use embedding here, we use different kind of encoding, which are integer encoding since using embedding, we represented each amino acid into vector.

## `r "2019-09-23" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Finished report before meeting.
- Contacted Dr. Aylin from EI.

#### Weekly catch up minutes

##### Sub-cellular localisation

- Points:
  - Ask Martin Aylin from EI to use the EI GPUs (make a draft email and send it to Dan first to check).
  - start the first model for subcellular compartment localisation (do not start from the fully connected dense, start from CNN-LSTM).

##### Effector-noneffector

- Points: 
  - Next time, if you know there is a service disruption, you can pause job or do the model check point.
  - From the results from CNN-LSTM, train manually and predict the test data.
  - Do grid search from other models.

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Tried to get the most optimized paramaters to scan using Scikit Learn RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV.

- Created parallel scripts from each models for RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV.

  - CNN-LSTM:
    - `0001-cnn-lstm-scan-batch16-unit16.py`.
    - `0002-cnn-lstm-scan-batch16-unit32.py`.
    - `0003-cnn-lstm-scan-batch32-unit16.py`.
    - `0004-cnn-lstm-scan-batch32-unit32.py`.

  - CNN-GRU:
    - `0005-cnn-gru-grid-batch8_gru_unit16.py`.
    - `0006-cnn-gru-grid-batch16_gru_unit32.py`.
    - `0007-cnn-gru-grid-batch8_gru_unit64.py`.
    - `0008-cnn-gru-grid-batch16_gru_unit16.py`.

  - GRU-Embedding:
    - `0010-gru-embedding_scan.py`.

  - LSTM-Embedding:
    - `0013-lstm-embedding-grid-batch8_lstm_unit16.py`.
    - `0014-lstm-embedding-grid-batch16_lstm_unit16.py`.
    - `0015-lstm-embedding-grid-batch8_lstm_unit32.py`.
    - `0016-lstm-embedding-grid-batch16_lstm_unit32.py`.

- Read about how to get accuracy for each class in multi-class compartment localisation.

#### Weekly catch up minutes

##### Sub-cellular localisation

- Points:
  - Make the scripts of subcellular multicompartment parallel.

##### Effector-noneffector

- Points:
  - Stop the CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU since no need to do again GridSearchCV.
  - Do not forget to check the memory of each job.
  - Check memory of each job.
