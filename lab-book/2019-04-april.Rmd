## `r "2019-04-10" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Met Dan for the research plan.
- Tried to complete the script of hyperparameters scan.
- Copied some protein IDs.


## `r "2019-04-11" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Copied manually the protein IDs until get the idea to find the `phi-base` GitHub repo.
- Started to clean the data to get the protein IDs.
- After got the protein IDs, then used it to get the sequence data.


## `r "2019-04-12" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Analysed and cleaned the sequence data from [uni-prot.org](uni-prot.org).

## `r "2019-04-15" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Finished reading Dan's paper.
- Tried to complete hyperparameter scan Model 1.

#### Minutes of weekly catch up meeting

- Finish the hyperparameter scan! (time management and prioritizing task skill should be improved!).
- Next task: get the data of non-effector from NCBI.


## `r "2019-04-16" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Finished hyper scan Model 1 and 2 scripts (run in GPU).


## `r "2019-04-17" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Tried to finish the Model 3 scripts.
- Getting the non-effector data from NCBI and phi-base.


## `r "2019-04-18" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, comment = "Half Day")`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Continue with getting the non-effector data.

#### Notes

- The first plan is to get the non-effector from [phi-base.org](phi-base.org), but some of the organism does not have sample non-effector data in [phi-base.org](phi-base.org). Solution: getting the sample from NCBI (using the query).

- Some of the organism names in `uniprot` have different name with some in [phi-base.org](phi-base.org), then I did mapping to get the original organism name. For example the protein ID `G2XWG3` in `phi-base`: *Botrytis cinerea*, whereas in  `uniprot`: *Botryotinia fuckeliana*. And when we search the non-effector in `phi-base` using *Botryotinia fuckeliana*, we will not find it, because it is not there. Then we need to map it back to get the original name. (The `phi-base` data is the main data for finding the non-effector data).

## `r "2019-04-23" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Obtained the intersect pathogen name of effector data from phi-base and uni-prot, identified the non-intersect one, and replace with the pathogen name from the phi-base.
- Added the running time in SBATCH scripts in tsl-gpu (one job got canceled bc of the time limit).


## `r "2019-04-24" -> curr_date; "2019-04-26" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date)
`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date, to_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Making reports.
- Check and match the incosistency data between phi-base and uniprot.
- Get data from NCBI (not complete yet).
- Focus on getting the non-effector data from phi-base big data.

## `r "2019-04-29" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Completed the report for weekly meeting catch-up.

#### Minutes of weekly catch-up

- Ask Dan if get stucks with something (biologist consideration is important, when dealing with data)
- Any progress should be reported, not always wait for it to be completed.
- **The gathering data process:**

  1. For the non effector, to get the propotional data, no need to be in species / organism level, can be in Order level >> get the classfication of each organism in NCBI whether it is Bacteria / Fungi / Oomycetes.
  2. Then just find the sequence samples based on the number of Order.


## `r "2019-04-30" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Completed the report for hyperparameter scan of the subcellular localisation project.
- Classified the effector data organism into three families: Bacteria, Fungus, or Oomycetes.
- Try to get the sequence data in NCBI with simple queries using.
