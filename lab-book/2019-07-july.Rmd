## `r "2019-07-01" -> curr_date; "2019-07-05" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Finished the function to get the effector data.

#### Weekly catch up minutes

- Do not get bother of having 2.5 % error in retriving non-effector data, just keep going.
- Think again about how do the hyperparamters scan on my scripts.
- Tried to get the anaylsis of the results of hyperparameters scan.
- Ran some manual hyperparameters scan using the best value using the model we have now (with early stopping and modelcheckpoint).
- Tried to understand how AttentionLayers work (has not managed to implement that).

#### Worked on

- Lab's day out with Proteomics group.

## `r "2019-07-09" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Weekly catch up minutes

##### Project 1
- Try to get the plot (not bloxplot) because it contains a lot of variability (not recommended), it is better using scatter plot for this kind of data.
- Note from Dan: by getting these results, it will actually help for the next moves (knowing which parameters work the best).

##### Project 2
- BLAST data and do small analysis on the amino acids sequence like length distribution and also different letter of the amin acids sequence.

## `r "2019-07-16" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

- Did a little analysis of the effector and non-effector data.
- Splitted data into three dataset.

#### Worked on

- Did the BLAST analysis to three different datasets.
