# May 2020 Lab Report <img src="figures/tsl-logo.png" align="right" width="120"/>

### [Ruth Kristianingsih](https://github.com/ruthkr)


## `r "2020-05-01" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- completing the report 

***


## `r "2020-05-04" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- focus on the API
  - do not use only x on the variable, and do not use pathogen (use model), since fungi/bacteria/oomyecte are not pathogen
- consider aastring set as a standard format of protein sequence, also dataframe
- see package [https://github.com/TeamMacLean/redpatch](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/redpatch) by Dan as an example to write test code, continous integration, and documentation (vignette)
- think about creating S3 object (nested dataframe), thinking about what kind of other output I can provide to the user instead of just dataframe of prediction results


## `r "2020-05-05" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- finished creating flowchart
- completed the MS 
- continued the benchmark process on `deepredeff`


## `r "2020-05-06" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- adding the new input class possibility: "AAString" and "AAStringset"
- corrected the API name 


## `r "2020-05-07" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- created the pkgdown set for documentating the package [https://github.com/ruthkr/deepredeff](https://github.com/ruthkr/deepredeff)
- fixing the bug on the main function
- parallel the load_model()

## `r "2020-05-08" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, comment = "Bank Holiday")`

Early May Bank Holiday  

***


## `r "2020-05-11" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- focus first on how I will design the API of the package 
- try to find Bioconductor package that can turn any input to AAString to dataframe ( no need to use additional function I got)
- small details to fix: license, package version, better documentation
- test scripts 

#### Worked on


## `r "2020-05-12" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- manuscripts
- designed the API for the package




## `r "2020-05-13" -> curr_date; "2020-05-15" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

#### Worked on

- package

  - trying to re-make the main function into S3 Objects for different classes
  - create more structured tbl_deepredeff object


***


## `r "2020-05-18" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- make simple tests, focus on functions that will get called by the users
- create Rmd that will be vignette: imagine you being a user so you can imagine what to expect
- no need to do autoplot if I can just use plot(): start with simple ggplot

## `r "2020-05-19" -> curr_date; "2020-05-22" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

#### Worked on

- add more sample data in Deepredeff, previously it was only two sequences for each pathogen
- solve testing problem for predict effector
- complete readme
- standardize the output df: name for input FASTA and df are trunctaed, but not if the input are AAString and AAStringset
- fix the autoplot
- continue the visualise convnet
- license
- making vignette
- complete some of the manuscript



#### Worked on
