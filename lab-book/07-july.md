Daily lab book July
====================

01 - 05 July 2019 (Monday - Friday)
------------------------------------

- finished the function to get the effector data

**Weekly catch up minutes**

- Do not get bother of having 2.5 % error in retriving non-effector data, just keep going
- Think again about how do the hyperparamters scan on my scripts

- tried to get the anaylsis of the results of hyperparameters scan
- ran some manual hyperparameters scan using the best value using the model we have now (with early stopping and modelcheckpoint)
- tried to understand how AttentionLayers work (has not managed to implement that)

Lab's day out with Proteomics group

09 July 2019 (Tuesday)
--------------------------

**Weekly catch up minutes**

- Project 1: try to get the plot (not bloxplot) because it contains a lot of variability (not recommended), it is better using scatter plot for this kind of data
Note from Dan: by getting this results, it will actually help for the next moves (knowing which parameters work the best)

- Project 2: BLAST data and do small analysis on the amino acids sequence like length distribution and also different letter of the amin acids sequence

10 - 15 July 2019 (Small Vacation)
--------------------------------------

16 July 2019 (Tuesday)
-----------------------

- did a little analysis of the effector and non-effector data
- splitted data into three dataset

17 July 2019 (Wednesday)
-------------------------

- did the BLAST analysis to three different datasets
