### [Ruth Kristianingsih](https://github.com/ruthkr)


## `r "2020-07-01" -> curr_date; "2020-07-03" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`


#### Worked on

- fixed several parts on the functions of package and also on the documentation and tutorials
- make `predict_effector()` function can handle vectors now 
- changed autoplot to plot, and change the color to color blind friendly
- fixed problems with loading user environment 

***

## `r "2020-07-06" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- revision of the Readme and the tutorials: not to put all data as it is too long, and also no need to show the chunck for some codes
- it's better to send the Rmd to Dan
- delete the option "all" since it is not included in the MS

## `r "2020-07-07" -> curr_date; "2020-07-10" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

#### Worked on

- fixed the Readme 
- updated the documentation of the functions
- deleted all functions related to "all" (default: bacteria)
- contacted people from reticulate 
- continued on getting the heatmap using TF 2.0

***

## `r "2020-07-13" -> curr_date; "2020-07-17" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date, to_date)`

- no meeting on this Monday

#### Worked on

- problem of reticulate solved
- try to see if there is something wrong with my code, since it is very slow
- find out why TF 2.0 is slower than TF 1.x
- rewrote heatmap code using @tf.function

***

## `r "2020-07-20" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r get_git_commit_count_from_path_list(git_path_list, curr_date)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- Dan agreed for me to submit the package to CRAN (I will be the maintainer)
- go ahead with heatmap using TF 2 although it is still very slow (mark as experimental)

## `r "2020-07-21" -> curr_date; "2020-07-24" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

#### Weekly catchup meeting

- finish all the convnet visualisation
- put it in master, no need to make it to make branch

- finish all commit
- clean up the computer
