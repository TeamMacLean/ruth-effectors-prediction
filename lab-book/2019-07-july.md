<!-- Commits: `#r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)` -->

#### Worked on

  - Finished the function to get the effector data.

#### Weekly catch up minutes

  - Do not get bother of having 2.5 % error in retriving non-effector
    data, just keep going.
  - Think again about how do the hyperparamters scan on my scripts.
  - Tried to get the anaylsis of the results of hyperparameters scan.
  - Ran some manual hyperparameters scan using the best value using the
    model we have now (with early stopping and modelcheckpoint).
  - Tried to understand how AttentionLayers work (has not managed to
    implement that).

##### Project 1

  - Try to get the plot (not bloxplot) because it contains a lot of
    variability (not recommended), it is better using scatter plot for
    this kind of data.
  - Note from Dan: by getting these results, it will actually help for
    the next moves (knowing which parameters work the best).

##### Project 2

  - BLAST data and do small analysis on the amino acids sequence like
    length distribution and also different letter of the amin acids
    sequence.
