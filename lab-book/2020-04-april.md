#### Worked on

  - making costumized venn diagram for the results of effector
    prediction
    [`plot_venn_diagram.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/plot_venn_diagram.R)

  - organised repositories for the python scripts

  - updated some R-scripts for:
    
      - plot correlation matrix (normal and clustered):
        [`plot_corr_matrix.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/plot_corr_matrix.R)
      - plot confusion matrix:
        [`plot_confusion_matrices.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/plot_confusion_matrices.R)
      - get accuracy given prediction results for multiple models in one
        dataframe:
        [`get_accuracy.R`](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/ruth-effectors-prediction/blob/master/scripts/r-scripts/r-functions/get_accuracy.R)

#### Worked on

  - tried to install some other existing effector prediction
tools:

Note that the last two is also bacteria, I will focus more on presenting
the one I have.

Commits: 2

#### Weekly catch up meeting:

  - making better comparison between prediction results using existing
    tools and tool I developed using some metrics like ROC, sensitivity,
    specificity ==\> contact Joe Win for the oomycete predictor
  - better waiting from the results from disopred than trying to new
    tool, that may take more time (and this additional part is not
    urgent / priority)
  - try to make function that can ensemble both two results (from venn
    diagram) for fungi ensemble
  - start to make package in R for the prediction tool

## 07–08 April 2020

Commits: 0

#### Worked on:

  - evaluate the oomycete data using the oomycete effector predictor
    `effectR`
  - read the R package procedure

## 09–13 April 2020– Easter Break

## 14–17 April 2020

Commits: 0

#### Worked on:

  - creating the package for effector prediction
    <https://github.com/ruthkr/effectorpred>
  - compare the previous work and our model with our model (calculate
    several metrics), also confusion matrices
  - updating the report

## 20 April 2020 (Monday)

Commits: 13

#### Weekly catch up meeting:

  - think about a package name that represent the goal, the methods,
    also the pathogen
  - since the prediction takes forever, then try to do benchmark to
    identify the problems, suspected problem sources:
      - the encoding part
      - the predict function used, maybe keras::predict\_proba() or
        keras::predict\_classes() instead of stats::predict
  - not necessarily put one function in different single files
  - think about what user may need and do
  - make user manual documentation

## 20–25 April 2020

Commits: 13

#### Worked on:

  - did several benchmarkings on each functions and calculated the
    timing of each function run
  - name changed from `effectorpred` to `deeffpred`
  - comparing the base package with the stringr, also function from the
    base package with keras function
  - completed the package

## 27 April 2020 (Monday)

Commits: 3

#### Weekly catch up meeting:

  - Dan suggested name `deepredeff` which is more pronouncable
  - tried to do profiling for all functions since the problem is that
    the combination of break down calculation time for each function
    does not match with the whole function running time. The whole
    function is very slow.
  - report need to be done
  - make the load data function parallel to minimize the running time
  - maybe defining the function init that initializes all model and
    paramaters

## 28–30 April 2020

Commits: 0

#### Worked on:

  - completing all ensembles
  - added the intefer encoding
  - completing reports
  - testing and benchmarking the R-package
      - testing on how actually purr effect on the computation time
      - testing between array and list input
  - uninstall and install both R and python, updated, since found out
    that the main problem
