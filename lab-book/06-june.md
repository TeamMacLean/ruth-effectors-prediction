Daily lab book June
====================


03 - 04 June 2019 (Monday - Tuesday)
------------------------------------

- made report of the models for both effector--noneffector and subcellular protein data
- wrote scripts hyperparameter scans for effector and noneffector protein data


05 June 2019 (Wednesday)
-------------------------

- had meeting at 10 am
- made the hyper-parameter scripts for the Conv1D model 

**Weekly catch up minutes**

- Project 1 (Subcellular Localisation)

    - Try to think alternative of other encoding method for the amino acids protein sequence (K-mer, CGR, or n-grams from K-mer)
    - For the CGR, due to the memory limitation, then probably the best mac depth is 5
    
- Project 2 (Effector - Noneffector protein)

    - Since the results are too good, too good to be true, I need to do further analysis on my data sets
    - Present to Dan for next meeting about the training data set I have
    - I can do the bootstrap random to select control set for the non-effector data sets. 

06 June 2019 (Thursday)
------------------------

- finished the hyperparameter scan scripts for Conv1D + LSTM
- find out other options of encoding amino acids
- tried to download the data as non-effector control sets
