## `r "2020-02-03" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Weekly meeting minutes: 

- need to run all of the four models we got for all different datasets and see the results
- after getting all of the results, then find the correlation between the prediction result for each models using Pearson-correlation-matrix ==> this will summarise the behaviour of the models (whether they are overlapping of completely separated)
- get another ensemble model (which using voting classifier, consenseus)
- run the multi-class classification data on the CNN-GRU model
- putting sigmoid in after calculating weighted average


## `r "2020-02-04" -> curr_date; "2020-02-07" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- created scripts for all models in different datasets : `LSTM_emb` and `GRU-emb` and get it running in cluster
- made report once models' training done
- created a script for CNN-GRU for multi-class classification subcellular-localisation
- created a function to make the pearson correlation matrix (ggplot)
- made function of weighted average and voting classifier ensemble

## `r "2020-02-10" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Activities:

- Going for a German visa application in London. 

## `r "2020-02-11" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Weekly meeting minutes:

- The next step of the model training is to manually tuning each model and plot using graph to see if its overfitting or not (comparing the training and validation data)
- the sigmoid function of the data is with range[0,1] not [-4, 4] ==> shifted sigmoid
- for the pearson correlation matrix, can you put the ensemble one on the corner?
- working also on the project report, since we want to publish it
- try to get another datasets from previous research done in the same topics (bacteria and fungi)

## `r "2020-02-12" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on:

- reset some commit 
- put the sigmoid function for the weighted average ensemble function (to make the function smoother) ==> using logistic function
- run again lstm_emb scan oomycete that failed earlier before, because the mistake on the unconsistent name of the data
- make the ensemble in the corner of Pearson correlation matrix functions ==> added a little code after pivotting the data
- started the scripts for the manual tuning 
- Upadates of the job running: there is no job finished yet
- updated the lab book for February 2020

## `r "2020-02-13" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`
 
#### Worked on: 

- put the sigmoid function for the weighted average ensemble method so that it will make the value smoother
- run again the lstm embedding model that fail earlier because of a bug and also resource problem
- make pearson correlation matrix ggplot with the ensemble models in the corner


## `r "2020-02-14" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on: 

- make the manually tuning for CNN-GRU and see if the models are overfitting (for the models done) for all:
  - bacteria
  - oomycete
  - fungi
  - all pathogen together
  
- make a script with the k-fold working
- make a report on how well each model performs

## `r "2020-02-17" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on:

- tuning manually the model with the extra epochs 
- for fungi oomycete: training manually with more epochs, since seems fungi is not good enough for only 30 epochs
- read some papers about previous project and made a losts on what methods and tricks to use, so that I can addapt it as well. 
- making some Rmd with different pathogens, so that we can see the progress of each manually tuning of the models, also to get the data from previous work (Transfer Learning)
- created a heatmap and simple graphs on python for Bacteria - CNN GRU

## `r "2020-02-18" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Weekly minutes:

- Focus first on getting the manually tuning done so that all of the models are finished and polish
- Try to make a story on the report, nice story, picture doesnt need to be with long description like in a paper
- for the line chart results of the CNN-GRU, try to smooth them (fourier transform)


## `r "2020-02-19" -> curr_date; "2020-02-21" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on:

- getting the smoother transformation using fft transformation
- took care of some job failed (because of the time limit)
- did analysis for some jobs that has finished
- continue the scripts on tuning manually the data
- ran the cnn-lstm Grad cam heatmap
- moved all the results to local directories for fungi, all, and bacteria

## `r "2020-02-24" -> curr_date; "2020-02-28" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

#### Activities:

- went to Germany for an interview
