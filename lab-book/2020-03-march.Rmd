### [Ruth Kristianingsih](https://github.com/ruthkr)

##   `r "2020-03-02" -> curr_date; "2020-03-03" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

#### Worked on

- ran again gru_emb for all data
- manually tuned the gru emb
- list all of the job that has been done and still in process
- running cnn lstm scripts for the grad came (where every epochs are saved, and also the weight --> 'acc')
- ran again lstm_emb_scan_all 
- apparently lstm emb and gru emb needs to be trained longer (ran again on cluster)
- analysed the results of cnn gru for oomycete and gru emb fungi

##  `r "2020-03-04" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- prioritizing on getting all CNN GRU perform well on datasets: fungi and oomycete
- Note on oomycete: the scodn model too overfitting, trying the third model which actuallt the first model with reduced gru hidden units but use the batch size = 8, instead of 4. And apparently this model is still overfitting, now trying the model 5 since it has lower or less filter conv + gru hidden units
- running to get the CNN GRU data saved (for heatmaps)
- organising the heatmap 
- report on the smoothing using fft
- Project report: making graphs for each nn architecture
- calculating heatmap matrices: bacteria cnn-lstm, fungi cnn-gru, and oomycete cnn-gru


##  `r "2020-03-05" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Weekly meeting

- ensemble the models that are already ready
- continue doing the heatmap and that

##  `r "2020-03-06" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- analysing the results of the data, plotting together and make function to compare on the result data

***

##  `r "2020-03-09" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`


#### Weekly meeting

- continued running manual training to get non-overfitting models
- Project report: need to fix the bib file, since it gives error, then send to Dan
- focus on ensemble
- change the color on the plot (its not useful to make diff color on the cross validation), make it different only for val and train
- learning rate/ dropout for overfitting models


##   `r "2020-03-10" -> curr_date; "2020-03-11" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- updating the report on manual tuning
- keep manually tuning on: 
  
  - lstm emb all
  - gru emb oomycete
  - cnn lstm all
  - gru emb all

##  `r "2020-03-11" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- parallel making the ensemble model for the models that are ready and also manually training some models that are not ready yet
- created some python modules
- updated: cnn_bacteria needs more epochs
- run the ensemble especially for bacteria, since they have finished already 

##  `r "2020-03-12" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- organising the repo on hpc home for fungi and oomycete
- make sure to get the best hyperparamaters for fungi
- checking and updating the results hyperparameters setting 
- update for fungi: CNN-GRU is still overfitting with filter = 8, gru hidden units = 8 >> need to reduce the filter = 4 and add dropout and recurrent dropout
- waiting for LSTM-CNN bacteria (60 epochs) to finish then attach it to the final model (still running)
- update for the reports:
  
  - Subcellular localisation: still missing so many things, and need to redo some plots to have the same format as in effector predictions
  - present the results of ensemble
  - present the results of convolutional and the plot of the results
  - hyperparameters analysis: result, random forest analysis
  
##  `r "2020-03-13" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- for the jobs that have finished already: 
  
  - eff cnn-lstm
  - cnn-lstm saved model: running it again for 100 epochs, and delete all of the droput and just reduce the filter (the main filter)
  - fungi cnn-gru model: run it again with the recurrent droput = 0.2
  - LSTM for oomycete is still overfitting, try manual fitting with reducing the filter
  
- bacteria ensembling model
- keep manually tuning for each data (note for the tuning is on my notebook)
  
##  `r "2020-03-16" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Weekly meeting 

- make the seqlogo of the the most activated position on the sequence
- continue all of waiting for the results >> and make ensembles for all data (oomycete, fungi, bacteria, and all pathogens)

#### Worked on

- preparing report for meeting with Dan
- finished first draft of report

##   `r "2020-03-17" -> curr_date; "2020-03-18" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

#### Worked on 

- created function to create a seq logo depending on which position we want to plot
- running 2 different parameters for fungi
- created join plot for all of the data (highly activated position) for all of the data

##  `r "2020-03-19" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on 

- project reports
- seq logo (learned about the different between using method bits and probability)
- working on some models of fungi, since they are not quite good yet

##  `r "2020-03-20" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Worked on 

- project reports
- finished all clustered correlation matrix
- again for fungi models
- running models for sucellular localisation (manual tuning)

##  `r "2020-03-23" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

#### Weekly meeting 

- try to ensemble only 2 models on fungi, since apparently using the ensemble for all models did not improve the models
- for the subcellular localisation, since I already have cnn-lstm and dense, tried to make ensemble using both models, and also will try cnn-gru for random hyparparamters and see how the results
- using the disopred to get the disordered protein and compare with the highly activated position using convolutional network

##   `r "2020-03-24" -> curr_date; "2020-03-27" -> to_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date, to_date, range = TRUE)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- updated the results on my report
- effector prediction: made the ensemble for fungi with different models
- subcellular localisation: run couple scripts of cnn-gru and find the best and non-overfitting models and also made the ensemble models fpr cnn-lstm, cnn-gru, and dense
- explored the `aaDescriptors()` package in R
- made the disopred program running (took me a while)
- made reports on each task, and also for the disopred results


##  `r "2020-03-30" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

I took a sick day. 

##  `r "2020-03-31" -> curr_date; get_formatted_date(curr_date)`

Commits: `r gitlogr::get_git_commit_count(curr_date)`

#### Worked on

- updating path on Rmd and commit to the repo in Dan's team repositories
- working on plotting disopred results

#### Weekly meeting 

- make the Venn diagram for ensemble fungi, since it seems that all models are subset from the CNN-LSTM (from the ensemble results)
- try to plot the results of prediction of disorder protein on the same scale as highly activated protein by cnn, and see if this correlated
- try to predict the training, val, and test model using the existed tool such as effectorP or bacteria effector prediction, pay attention on the cut off (p-value)
