## 02–03 March 2020

#### Worked on

  - ran again gru\_emb for all data
  - manually tuned the gru emb
  - list all of the job that has been done and still in process
  - running cnn lstm scripts for the grad came (where every epochs are
    saved, and also the weight –\> ‘acc’)
  - ran again lstm\_emb\_scan\_all
  - apparently lstm emb and gru emb needs to be trained longer (ran
    again on cluster)
  - analysed the results of cnn gru for oomycete and gru emb fungi

## 04 March 2020 (Wednesday)

#### Worked on

  - prioritizing on getting all CNN GRU perform well on datasets: fungi
    and oomycete
  - Note on oomycete: the scodn model too overfitting, trying the third
    model which actuallt the first model with reduced gru hidden units
    but use the batch size = 8, instead of 4. And apparently this model
    is still overfitting, now trying the model 5 since it has lower or
    less filter conv + gru hidden units
  - running to get the CNN GRU data saved (for heatmaps)
  - organising the heatmap
  - report on the smoothing using fft
  - Project report: making graphs for each nn architecture
  - calculating heatmap matrices: bacteria cnn-lstm, fungi cnn-gru, and
    oomycete cnn-gru

## 05 March 2020 (Thursday)

Commits: 0

#### Weekly meeting

  - ensemble the models that are already ready
  - continue doing the heatmap and that

## 06 March 2020 (Friday)

#### Worked on

  - analysing the results of the data, plotting together and make
    function to compare on the result data

-----

## 09 March 2020 (Monday)

#### Weekly meeting

  - continued running manual training to get non-overfitting models
  - Project report: need to fix the bib file, since it gives error, then
    send to Dan
  - focus on ensemble
  - change the color on the plot (its not useful to make diff color on
    the cross validation), make it different only for val and train
  - learning rate/ dropout for overfitting models

## 10–11 March 2020

Commits: 0

#### Worked on

  - updating the report on manual tuning

  - keep manually tuning on:
    
      - lstm emb all
      - gru emb oomycete
      - cnn lstm all
      - gru emb all

## 11 March 2020 (Wednesday)

#### Worked on

  - parallel making the ensemble model for the models that are ready and
    also manually training some models that are not ready yet
  - created some python modules
  - updated: cnn\_bacteria needs more epochs
  - run the ensemble especially for bacteria, since they have finished
    already

## 12 March 2020 (Thursday)

#### Worked on

  - organising the repo on hpc home for fungi and oomycete

  - make sure to get the best hyperparamaters for fungi

  - checking and updating the results hyperparameters setting

  - update for fungi: CNN-GRU is still overfitting with filter = 8, gru
    hidden units = 8 \>\> need to reduce the filter = 4 and add dropout
    and recurrent dropout

  - waiting for LSTM-CNN bacteria (60 epochs) to finish then attach it
    to the final model (still running)

  - update for the reports:
    
      - Subcellular localisation: still missing so many things, and need
        to redo some plots to have the same format as in effector
        predictions
      - present the results of ensemble
      - present the results of convolutional and the plot of the results
      - hyperparameters analysis: result, random forest analysis

## 13 March 2020 (Friday)

#### Worked on

  - for the jobs that have finished already:
    
      - eff cnn-lstm
      - cnn-lstm saved model: running it again for 100 epochs, and
        delete all of the droput and just reduce the filter (the main
        filter)
      - fungi cnn-gru model: run it again with the recurrent droput =
        0.2
      - LSTM for oomycete is still overfitting, try manual fitting with
        reducing the filter

  - bacteria ensembling model

  - keep manually tuning for each data (note for the tuning is on my
    notebook)

## 16 March 2020 (Monday)

#### Weekly meeting

  - make the seqlogo of the the most activated position on the sequence
  - continue all of waiting for the results \>\> and make ensembles for
    all data (oomycete, fungi, bacteria, and all pathogens)

#### Worked on

  - preparing report for meeting with Dan
  - finished first draft of report

## 17–18 March 2020

#### Worked on

  - created function to create a seq logo depending on which position we
    want to plot
  - running 2 different parameters for fungi
  - created join plot for all of the data (highly activated position)
    for all of the data

## 19 March 2020 (Thursday)

#### Worked on

  - project reports
  - seq logo (learned about the different between using method bits and
    probability)
  - working on some models of fungi, since they are not quite good yet

## 20 March 2020 (Friday)

#### Worked on

  - project reports
  - finished all clustered correlation matrix
  - again for fungi models
  - running models for sucellular localisation (manual tuning)

## 23 March 2020 (Monday)

#### Weekly meeting

  - try to ensemble only 2 models on fungi, since apparently using the
    ensemble for all models did not improve the models
  - for the subcellular localisation, since I already have cnn-lstm and
    dense, tried to make ensemble using both models, and also will try
    cnn-gru for random hyparparamters and see how the results
  - using the disopred to get the disordered protein and compare with
    the highly activated position using convolutional network

## 24–27 March 2020

Commits: 0

#### Worked on

  - updated the results on my report
  - effector prediction: made the ensemble for fungi with different
    models
  - subcellular localisation: run couple scripts of cnn-gru and find the
    best and non-overfitting models and also made the ensemble models
    fpr cnn-lstm, cnn-gru, and dense
  - explored the `aaDescriptors()` package in R
  - made the disopred program running (took me a while)
  - made reports on each task, and also for the disopred results

## 30 March 2020 (Monday)

I took a sick day.

## 31 March 2020 (Tuesday)

Commits: 38

#### Worked on

  - updating path on Rmd and commit to the repo in Dan’s team
    repositories
  - working on plotting disopred results

#### Weekly meeting

  - make the Venn diagram for ensemble fungi, since it seems that all
    models are subset from the CNN-LSTM (from the ensemble results)
  - try to plot the results of prediction of disorder protein on the
    same scale as highly activated protein by cnn, and see if this
    correlated
  - try to predict the training, val, and test model using the existed
    tool such as effectorP or bacteria effector prediction, pay
    attention on the cut off (p-value)
