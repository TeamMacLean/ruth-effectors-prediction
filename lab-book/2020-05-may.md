#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - focus on the API
      - do not use only x on the variable, and do not use pathogen (use
        model), since fungi/bacteria/oomyecte are not pathogen
  - consider aastring set as a standard format of protein sequence, also
    dataframe
  - see package <https://github.com/TeamMacLean/redpatch> by Dan as an
    example to write test code, continous integration, and documentation
    (vignette)
  - think about creating S3 object (nested dataframe), thinking about
    what kind of other output I can provide to the user instead of just
    dataframe of prediction results
