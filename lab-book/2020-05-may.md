## 04 May 2020 (Monday)

Commits: 0

#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - focus on the API
      - do not use only x on the variable, and do not use pathogen (use
        model), since fungi/bacteria/oomyecte are not pathogen
  - consider aastring set as a standard format of protein sequence, also
    dataframe
  - see package <https://github.com/TeamMacLean/redpatch> by Dan as an
    example to write test code, continous integration, and documentation
    (vignette)
  - think about creating S3 object (nested dataframe), thinking about
    what kind of other output I can provide to the user instead of just
    dataframe of prediction results

## 05 May 2020 (Tuesday)

## 11 May 2020 (Monday)

Commits: 5

#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - focus first on how I will design the API of the package
  - try to find Bioconductor package that can turn any input to AAString
    to dataframe ( no need to use additional function I got)
  - small details to fix: license, package version, better documentation
  - test scripts

#### Worked on

## 12 May 2020 (Tuesday)

Commits: 9

#### Worked on

  - manuscripts
  - designed the API for the package

## 13–15 May 2020

Commits: 9

#### Worked on

  - package
    
      - trying to re-make the main function into S3 Objects for
        different classes
      - create more structured tbl\_deepredeff object

## 18 May 2020 (Monday)

Commits: 5

#### Weekly catchup meeting

  - make simple tests, focus on functions that will get called by the
    users
  - create Rmd that will be vignette: imagine you being a user so you
    can imagine what to expect
  - no need to do autoplot if I can just use plot(): start with simple
    ggplot

## 19–22 May 2020

Commits: 27

#### Worked on

  - add more sample data in Deepredeff, previously it was only two
    sequences for each pathogen
  - solve testing problem for predict effector
  - complete readme
  - standardize the output df: name for input FASTA and df are
    trunctaed, but not if the input are AAString and AAStringset
  - fix the autoplot
  - continue the visualise convnet
  - license
  - making vignette
  - complete some of the manuscript
